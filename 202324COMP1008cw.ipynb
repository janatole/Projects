    "<b>Main task</b>: Choose <b>one</b> of the following datasets. Build a linear regression model and another machine learning model of your choice to conduct predictions on future new unseen data. Use approporate methods in pandas, matplotlib and sklearn libraries to analyse and process your dataset for building models for your chosen prediction task.\n",
    "- Movies_Ratings: predict movie ratings\n",
    "- Shared_Bike_Demand: predict bike sharing demand\n",
    "- Forest_Fires_Area: predict areas of forest fires\n",
    "- Obesity_Level: predict level of obesity\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Format</b>: Use this Jupyter Notebook file as a template to write your report in `Markdown` cells, supported by your appropriate source codes in `Code` cells which produce the corresponding plots or results answering the questions. Rename this .ipynb file `202324COMP1008cw-XXX.ipynb`, where XXX is your username (e.g. psxyz), and submit it to Moodle by <b><font color = \"red\">22 March, 3pm</font></b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: In total 100 marks (count for 25% in COMP1008), awarded on the basis of understanding on machine learning theories, how informative and well presented your code, visualisations and results are (e.g. comment for code, necessary labels in plots), self-learning ability solving the specific problem, and succinct report writing.\n",

This is so that the MSE (Mean Squared Error) can be calculated and minimised. Additionally, Linear Regression is a form of Supervised Learning therefore needs labelled training data in which each example has an input and desired output. As I have chosen to predict the level of Obesity, weight is a category that is labelled and can be stored continously. This trend follows with other categories such as height and age."
